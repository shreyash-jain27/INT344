Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 Independent Auditor’s Report To The Members of Infosys Limited Report on the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements Opinion We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of INFOSYS LIMITED (the “Company”) and its subsidiaries (the Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the “Group”) which comprise the Consolidated Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2025, and the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity and the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the year ended on that date, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of material accounting policies and other explanatory information (hereinafter referred to as the “Consolidated Financial Statements”). In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid Consolidated Financial Statements, give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (the “Act”) in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with the Indian Accounting Standards prescribed under section 133 of the Act, (“Ind AS”) and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the consolidated state of affairs of the Group as at March 31, 2025 and their consolidated profit, their consolidated total comprehensive income, their consolidated changes in equity and their consolidated cash flows for the year ended on that date. Basis for Opinion We conducted our audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (“SAs”) specified under section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (“ICAI”) together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements under the provisions of the Act and the Rules made thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ICAI’s Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence obtained by us is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements. Key Audit Matters Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. We have determined the matters described below to be the key audit matters to be communicated in our report. 293 Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 Sr. No. Key Audit Matter 1 Revenue recognition The Group’s contracts with customers include contracts with products and services. The group derives revenues from IT services comprising software development and related services, maintenance, consulting and package implementation, licensing of software products and platforms across the Group’s core and digital offerings and business process management services. The Group assesses the services promised in a contract and identifies distinct performance obligations in the contract. Identification of distinct performance obligations to determine the deliverables and the ability of the customer to benefit independently from such deliverables involves significant judgement. In certain integrated services arrangements, contracts with customers include subcontractor services or third-party vendor equipment or software. In these types of arrangements, revenue from sales of third-party vendor products or services is recorded net of costs when the Group is acting as an agent between the customer and the vendor, and gross when the Group is the principal for the transaction. In doing so, the Group first evaluates whether it obtains control of the specified goods or services before it is transferred to the customer. The Group considers whether it is primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide the specified goods or services, inventory risk, pricing discretion and other factors to determine whether it controls the products or service and therefore, is acting as a principal or an agent. Fixed price maintenance revenue is recognized ratably either on (1) a straight-line basis when services are performed through an indefinite number of repetitive acts over a specified period or (2) using a percentage of completion method when the pattern of benefits from the services rendered to the customer and the Group’s costs to fulfil the contract is not even through the period of contract because the services are generally discrete in nature and not repetitive. The use of method to recognize the maintenance revenues requires judgment and is based on the promises in the contract and nature of the deliverables. As certain contracts with customers involve management’s judgment in (1) identifying distinct performance obligations, (2) determining whether the Group is acting as a principal or an agent and (3) whether fixed price maintenance revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis or using the percentage of completion method, revenue recognition from these judgments were identified as a key audit matter and required a higher extent of audit effort. Refer Notes 1.5 and 2.18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Auditor’s Response Principal Audit Procedures Performed included the following: Our audit procedures related to the (1) identification of distinct performance obligations, (2) determination of whether the Group is acting as a principal or agent and (3) whether fixed price maintenance revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis or using the percentage of completion method included the following, among others: • We tested the effectiveness of controls relating to the (a) identification of distinct performance obligations, (b) determination of whether the Group is acting as a principal or an agent and (c) determination of whether fixed price maintenance revenue for certain contracts is recognized on a straight-line basis or using the percentage of completion method. • We selected a sample of contracts with customers and performed the following procedures: obligations, (2) determination of whether the Group is acting as a principal or agent and (3) whether fixed price maintenance revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis or using the percentage of completion method included the following, among others: – Obtained and read contract documents for each selection, including master service agreements, and other documents that were part of the agreement. – Identified significant terms and deliverables in the contract to assess management’s conclusions regarding the (i) identification of distinct performance obligations (ii) whether the Group is acting as a principal or an agent and (iii) whether fixed price maintenance revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis or using the percentage of completion method 294 Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 Sr. No. Key Audit Matter 2 Revenue recognition - Fixed price contracts using the percentage of completion method Fixed price maintenance revenue is recognized ratably either (1) on a straight-line basis when services are performed through an indefinite number of repetitive acts over a specified period or (2) using a percentage of completion method when the pattern of benefits from services rendered to the customer and the Group’s costs to fulfil the contract is not even through the period of contract because the services are generally discrete in nature and not repetitive. Revenue from other fixed-price, fixed-timeframe contracts, where the performance obligations are satisfied over time is recognized using the percentage- of-completion method. Use of the percentage-of-completion method requires the Group to determine the actual efforts or costs expended to date as a proportion of the estimated total efforts or costs to be incurred. Efforts or costs expended have been used to measure progress towards completion as there is a direct relationship between input and productivity. The estimation of total efforts or costs involves significant judgement and is assessed throughout the period of the contract to reflect any changes based on the latest available information. Provisions for estimated losses, if any, on uncompleted contracts are recorded in the period in which such losses become probable based on the estimated efforts or costs to complete the contract. We identified the estimate of total efforts or costs to complete fixed price contracts measured using the percentage of completion method as a key audit matter as the estimation of total efforts or costs involves significant judgement and is assessed throughout the period of the contract to reflect any changes based on the latest available information. This estimate has a high inherent uncertainty and requires consideration of progress of the contract, efforts or costs incurred to-date and estimates of efforts or costs required to complete the remaining contract performance obligations over the term of the contracts. This required a high degree of auditor judgment in evaluating the audit evidence and a higher extent of audit effort to evaluate the reasonableness of the total estimated amount of revenue recognized on fixed-price contracts. Refer Notes 1.5 and 2.18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Auditor’s Response Principal Audit Procedures Performed included the following: Our audit procedures related to estimates of total expected costs or efforts to complete for fixed-price contracts included the following, among others: • We tested the effectiveness of controls relating to (1) recording of efforts or costs incurred and estimation of efforts or costs required to complete the remaining contract performance obligations and (2) access and application controls pertaining to time recording, allocation and budgeting systems which prevents unauthorised changes to recording of efforts incurred. • We selected a sample of fixed price contracts with customers measured the using percentage-of-completion method and performed the following: – Evaluated management’s ability to reasonably estimate the progress towards satisfying the performance obligation by comparing actual efforts or costs incurred to prior year estimates of efforts or costs budgeted for performance obligations that have been fulfilled. – Compared efforts or costs incurred with Group’s estimate of efforts or costs incurred to date to identify significant variations and evaluate whether those variations have been considered appropriately in estimating the remaining costs or efforts to complete the contract. – Tested the estimate for consistency with the status of delivery of milestones and customer acceptances and sign off from customers to identify possible delays in achieving milestones, which require changes in estimated costs or efforts to complete the remaining performance obligations. 295 Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 Information Other than the Financial Statements and Auditor’s Report Thereon The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation of the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the Management Discussion and Analysis, Board’s Report including Annexures to Board’s Report, Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report, Corporate Governance and Shareholder’s Information, but does not include the Consolidated Financial Statements, standalone financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon. Our opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. In connection with our audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements, our responsibility is to read the other information, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the Consolidated Financial Statements or our knowledge obtained during the course of our audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard. Responsibilities of Management and Board of Directors for the Consolidated Financial Statements The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the matters stated in section 134(5) of the Act with respect to the preparation and presentation of these Consolidated Financial Statements that give a true and fair view of the consolidated financial position, consolidated financial performance including other comprehensive income, consolidated changes in equity and consolidated cash flows of the Group in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, including Ind AS specified under section 133 of the Act. The respective Boards of Directors/Trustees of the entities included in the Group are responsible for maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding the assets of the Group and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, which have been used for the purpose of preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements by the Directors of the Company, as aforesaid. In preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements, the respective Boards of Directors/Trustees of the entities included in the Group are responsible for assessing the ability of the respective entities to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the respective Boards of Directors either intends to liquidate their respective entities or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so. The respective Boards of Directors/Trustees of the entities included in the Group are also responsible for overseeing the financial reporting process of the Group. Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Consolidated Financial Statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these Consolidated Financial Statements. As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also: • Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the Consolidated Financial Statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. • Obtain an understanding of internal financial control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the Company and its subsidiary companies which are companies incorporated in India, has adequate internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls. • Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the management. • Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the ability of the Group to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the Consolidated Financial Statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify 296 Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern. • Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the Consolidated Financial Statements, including the disclosures, and whether the Consolidated Financial Statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. • Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities within the Group to express an opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements. Materiality is the magnitude of misstatements in the Consolidated Financial Statements that, individually or in aggregate, makes it probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable user of the Consolidated Financial Statements may be influenced. We consider quantitative materiality and qualitative factors in (i) planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work; and (ii) to evaluate the effect of any identified misstatements in the Consolidated Financial Statements. We communicate with those charged with governance of the Company and such other entities included in the Consolidated Financial Statements of which we are the independent auditors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal financial controls that we identify during our audit. We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards. From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters.

Management’s and Board of Directors’ Responsibilities for Internal Financial Control The respective Company’s management and Boards of Directors of the Company and its subsidiary companies, which are companies incorporated in India, are responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial controls based on the internal control over financial reporting criteria established by the respective Companies considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (the “ICAI”). These responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to the respective company’s policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the Act. Auditor’s Responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company and its subsidiary companies, which are companies incorporated in India, based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting (the “Guidance Note”) issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (“ICAI”) and the Standards on Auditing, prescribed under Section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements was established and maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all material respects. Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements included obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company and its subsidiary companies, which are companies incorporated in India. 300 Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements A company's internal financial control with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal financial control with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management and directors of the Company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial control with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Opinion In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the Company and its subsidiary companies, which are companies incorporated in India, have, in all material respects, an adequate internal financial controls system with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements and such internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements were operating effectively as at March 31, 2025, based on the criteria for internal financial control with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements established by the respective companies considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the ICAI.

Members may note that the Income-tax Act, 1961, (“the IT Act”) as amended by the Finance Act, 2020, mandates that dividend paid or distributed by a company on or after April 1, 2020 shall be taxable in the hands of members. The Company shall therefore be required to deduct tax at source (TDS) at the time of making the payment of final dividend. To enable us to determine the appropriate TDS rate as applicable, members are requested to submit relevant documents, as specified in the below paragraphs, in accordance with the provisions of the IT Act. For resident shareholders, taxes shall be deducted at source under Section 194 of the IT Act as follows: 10%* Members having valid Permanent Account Number (PAN) or as notified by the Government of India (GOI) Members not having PAN / valid PAN 20% or as notified by the GOI * As per Section 139AA of the IT Act, every person who has been allotted a PAN and who is eligible to obtain Aadhaar, shall be required to link the PAN with Aadhaar. In case of failure to comply with this, the PAN allotted shall be deemed to be invalid / inoperative and he shall be liable to all consequences under the IT Act and tax shall be deducted at the higher rates as provided in section 206AA of the IT Act, 1961 i.e., 20% of tax deduction at source. However, no tax shall be deducted on the dividend payable to resident individual shareholders if the total dividend to be received by them during financial year 2025-2026 does not exceed ₹10,000 and also in cases where members provide Form 15G / Form 15H (Form 15H is applicable to resident individual shareholders aged 60 years or more), subject to conditions specified in the IT Act. Resident shareholders may also submit any other document as prescribed under the IT Act to claim a lower / nil withholding of tax. PAN is mandatory for members providing Form 15G / 15H or any other document as mentioned above. For non-resident shareholders, taxes are required to be withheld in accordance with the provisions of Section 195 and other applicable sections of the IT Act, at the rates in force. The withholding tax shall be at the rate of 20% (plus applicable surcharge and cess) or as notified by the GOI on the amount of dividend payable. However, as per Section 90 of the IT Act, non-resident shareholders have the option to be governed by the provisions of the Double Tax Avoidance Agreement (DTAA), read with Multilateral Instrument (MLI), between India and the country of tax residence of the shareholders, if they are more beneficial to them.
