Capital Management For the purpose of Group’s Capital Management, capital includes Issued Equity Capital, Securities Premium, and all other Equity Reserves attributable to the Equity Holders of the Group. The primary objective of the Group’s Capital Management is to maximise the Share Holder Value. The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments in the light of changes in economic conditions and requirements of the financial covenants and to continue as a going concern. The Group monitors using a gearing ratio which is net debts divided by total capital plus net debt. The Group includes within net debt, interest bearing loans and borrowings, less cash and short term deposit. B. Financial Risk Management The Group’s principal financial liabilities comprise loans and borrowings, lease liability, trade and other payables. The main purpose of these financial liabilities is to finance the operations of the Group. The principal financial assets include trade and other receivables, investments in mutual funds, Bonds, cash and short term deposits. The Group has assessed market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk to its financial instruments. i) Market Risk Is the risk of loss of future earnings, fair values or cash flows that may result from a change in the price of a financial instrument, as a result of interest rates, foreign exchange rates and other price risks. Financial instruments affected by market risks, primarily include loans & borrowings, investments and foreign currency receivables, payables and borrowings. a) Interest Rate Risk: The Group borrows funds in Indian Rupees and Foreign currency, to meet both the long term and short term funding requirements. The Interest rate risk in terms of Foreign currency is managed through financial instruments available to convert floating rate liability into fixed rate liability. The Group due to its AAA rated status commands one of the cheapest source of funding. Interest rate is fixed for the tenor of the Long term loans availed by the Group. Interest on Short term borrowings is subject to floating interest rate and are repriced regularly. The sensitivity analysis detailed below have been determined based on the exposure to variable interest rates on the average outstanding amounts due to bankers over a year. The Group had issued floating interest rate Non-convertible debentures linked to 6 month T-Bill rate, to meet long term funding requirements. If the interest rates had been 1% higher / lower and all other variables held constant, the Group’s profit for the year ended 31st March, 2024 ` ` would have been decreased/increased by 14.25 Crores (Previous year 16.56 Crores). 191 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31ST MARCH 2024 b) Currency Risk: Foreign currency risks from financial instruments at the end of the reporting period expressed in INR : (` Unhedged Short Term Exposures : Crores) 31.03.2024 31.03.2023 Financial Assets 193.53 199.27 Financial Liabilites 324.21 179.76 The company is mainly exposed to changes in US Dollar.

The Sensitivity analysis is prepared on the net unhedged exposure of the Company at the reporting date. Hedged Foreign Currency exposures : Foreign Exchange forward Contracts on certain highly probable forecast transactions, are measured at fair value through OCI on being designated as Cash Flow Hedges. The Group also enters into foreign exchange forward contracts with the intention to minimise the foreign exchange risk of expected purchases, these contracts are not designated in hedge relationships and are measured at fair value through profit or loss.
